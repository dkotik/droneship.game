Two friends went through dozens of start up ideas for months. They wanted to take a risk. Perhaps, try to change the world for the better. They could not come up with anything worthwhile. They knew only one thing: they wanted to do "it" together. But what that might be?

Making a game is a terrible business idea. The vast majority never get finished. Those that do drown in the stream of negative reviews. Most independent studios remain one-shot wonders for years.

The market appears saturated by lone developers putting each other out of business. There are two of us. We know how to have fun together. So, why not?

We definitely do not know what we are doing.

This is the dumbest idea ever. Wish us luck.
